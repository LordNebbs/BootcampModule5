## Overview of the analysis.


-  Analyse and graph data using the Matplotlib library. 

-  PyBer, a rideshare company needed raw data analyzed to visualize monthly ride fare ammounts based on the types of cities the company operates in.

### Results:

The following data was able to be condensed and visualized.

# Summary:

-   Based on the results, the three business recommendations to Pyber leadership is as follows:

The lack of drivers in rural areas is directly correlated to higher prices and consequently lower usage of rideshares. If drivers were reallocated from urban areas, not only would it lower the burden on the rural drivers as it stands but it would lower prices for the user which will encourage more widespread use. While monthly fares vary month to month, the line plot provided suggest that it only does so slightly over the course of the year, making expansion into the rural area much more tenable. A simimlar plan could be applied to suburban areas as well.
